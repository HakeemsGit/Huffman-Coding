# Huffman-Coding
A Huffman Coding Data Structure built in C.

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters where lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the  smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code. The algorithm is desiged based on a Tree type data structure, where the nodes of each character and their frequency will be stored. The ultimate goal is to translate ASCII characters to a Binary representation.
